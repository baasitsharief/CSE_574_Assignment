# Task

The task of this project is to perform classification using machine learning. It is for a two class problem. Your task is to classify whether a patient has diabetes(class 1) or not (class 0), based on the diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset, using logistic regression and neural network as the classifier. The dataset in use is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database(diabetes.csv). The code should be written in Python.

# Dataset

Pima Indians Diabetes Database dataset will be used for training, and testing. The dataset contains medical data of female patients above the age of 21 and 768 instances with the diagnostic measurements of 8 features. The 8 features are as follows: <br>

        1 Glucose (Blood Glucose level) <br>
        2 Pregnancies (The number of pregnancies the patient has had)<br>
        3 Blood Pressure(mm Hg)<br>
        4 Skin Thickness(Triceps skin fold thickness (mm))<br>
        5 Insulin level<br>
        6 BMI (Body Mass Index : weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br>
        7 Diabetes Pedigree Function<br>
        8 Age (In years)<br>
