# Assignment 3 - QLearning

The goal of the assignment is to learn the trends in stock price and perform a series of trades over a period
of time and end with a profit. In each trade you can either buy/sell/hold. You will start with an investment
capital of $100,000 and your performance is measured as a percentage of the return on investment.
You will use the Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning to train an agent to learn the trends
in stock price and perform a series of trades. You will implement Q-learning algorithm from scratch. The
purpose of this assignment is to understand the benefits of using reinforcement learning to solve the real
world problem of stock trading.
