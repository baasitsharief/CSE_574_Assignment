# Task

The task of the project is to perform unsupervised learning on Cifar 10 dataset. There are two task,
the first is to perform K-means clustering on the raw data from scratch. The second is to perform K-means clustering on a representation generated by the Auto-Encoder method using library functions.
The code should be written in Python using Keras.


# Dataset

The Cifar 10 dataset has a training set of 50,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each
example is a 32x32 image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Each image is 32 pixels in height
and 32 pixels in width, for a total of 1024 pixels in total. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and
255. The training and test data sets have 1025 columns including the labels.
